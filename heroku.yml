  # Specify which buildpacks to use.
  packs:

  # Specify any scripts or commands that need to be run to build your application.
  # It could include copying frontend build output to the Spring Boot static directory,
  # but this depends on how you want to serve your frontend assets.
  # If your backend is a Spring Boot application that serves the frontend files, you might do something like this:
  scripts:
    - npm install --prefix frontend
    - npm run build --prefix frontend
    - cp -R frontend/dist/* backend/src/main/resources/static/
  # Define how to build the backend if it's not just running `mvn package`
  # For example, if you need to navigate to the backend directory first:
    - cd backend && mvn package
